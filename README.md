## JaguarDB is the Best NoSQL Database For AI, IoT ##

**AI and IoT Data**

JaguarDB is extremely scalable, best suited for AI and Internet of Things (IoT) which handles large volumes of
identity data, knowledge information, events data, location data, and time series data.
JaguarDB can scale out horizontally 1 million times faster than any distributed systems that use
consistent-hashing algorithm. JaguarDB scales a large database system in seconds without 
causing interruptions to your database system.  Imagine you will have million trillions of data elements, 
JaguarDB is perfect for your IT system.

**Instant Scaling**

In traditional way of horizontal scaling of distributed database systems, data migration is required and may
take a `LONG time`, referred as scaling nightmare. JaguarDB, with our unique Zero-Move Hash (ZMHash) technology,
does not require any data migration and can scale to thousands or millions of nodes
`INSTANTLY`, taking only a second or even less. 
JaguarDB scales the system by adding whole clusters where each cluster contains a volume of nodes.
Other database systems can only add a node one at a time. JaguarDB allows you to add thousands of nodes
 or more in one step. This is why JaguarDB can scale with lightning speed.


**AI Data**

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are trained using large amounts of data to learn and improve their performance. 
This is because AI algorithms use statistical techniques to find patterns and make predictions based on the data 
they have been trained on. The more diverse and representative the data is, the better the AI will be able to 
learn and generalize from that data.

To create accurate and reliable AI models, it is important to ensure that the data used for training is of high quality, 
well-structured, and covers a wide range of scenarios and use cases. This allows the AI to learn from a 
variety of perspectives and make more accurate predictions or decisions when applied to new data.

Therefore, having lots of good data is essential for developing robust and accurate AI models that can be applied 
in a variety of contexts and provide value to businesses and individuals alike. Good data comes from a well-managed database
where knowledge and facts are maintained and fed to the AI systems to achieve another level of intelligence.


**Location Data**

JaguarDB is the only database that supports both vector and raster spatial data.
Vector spatial shapes include line, square, rectangle, circle, ellipse, triangle, sphere, ellipsoid, cone,
cylinder, box, 3D line, 3D square, 3D rectangle, 3D circle, 3D ellipse, and 3D triangle.

Raster spatial shapes include point, multipoint, linestring, multilinestring, polygon, multipolygon, 
and their 3D counterparts. 

Other databases support only one tag at a location, while JaguarDB supports unlimited tags at a location.
This can be useful for analyzing complex location-based data and metrics.

**Time Series Data**

JaguarDB enables fast ingestion of time series data, coupling location-based data. It also can index in both dimensions, 
space and time. Back-filling time series data is also fast (inserting large volumes of data in past time).
Automatic aggregation of data in multiple time windows are also performed by JaguarDB so you can get the
aggregated data immediately without any extra computing work. 
Along with our `Instant Scaling` technology, you 
store the forever growing data without any downtime or interuption.

**File Storage and Search**

You can upload your data files, video files, photo files, or any file to your JaguarDB system. When you upload,
you can attach key words or tags to each file. Then later you will be able to search trillions of files
using the keywords, or tags in JaguarDB which makes finding the needle in the hay-stack process a million times easier.
Our `Instant Scaling` technology enables your IT system to store and search trillions of files and more.
Jaguar storage system provides the most scalable infrastructure for AI training and IoT datalakes.

## JaguarDB History ##

Our original repository was in https://github.com/datajaguar/jaguardb but due to accidental checkin of some large
binary packages, checking out the repository met some issues. The development of JaguarDB started in 2013 and 
the public repository was checked in github at 2017. After 10 years of development, JaguarDB now has reached milestones
in the scalability, feature set, high availability, and stability.

## Compiled Binary Package ##
You can build the binary programs from the github repository. However, since JaguarDB requires several
third-party packages and if you do not have time to build, you can directly visit our web site and just download
an already-built package for JaguarDB:
